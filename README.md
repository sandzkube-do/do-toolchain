# DevOps Team Toolchain

A set of tools that enables the DevOps culture of "Automating Everything", "Infrastructure as Code", "Pipeline as code", Workspace as code, and "Relentless Automation".

These tools includes the Kubernetes CLI (kubectl), Openshift CLI (oc), Openshift DO CLI (odo), Private Git Repository (gitea), Openshift Code Ready Containers (OCP4), VS Code, Eclipse Che, Tekton, Nexus, Sonarqube, Ansible, etc.

## Kubernetes on your Laptop

  As DevOps, whether you are a Developer or Ops/SRE specializing for cloud-native applications, it is highly recommended that you have the capability to bring up an enterprise kubernetes instance like Openshift in your laptop/desktop. Top of mind in this particular case is the CRC or Code-Ready Containers to experience openshift 4.x. 
  
  Alternatively, the Developer/Ops/SRE wearing the DevOps can also opt to get dirty or have theri hands soiled with other open-source tools like Minikube or try out the older version 3 of Openshift.

  ### Prerequisites

  As a DevOps whether your role is a Developer and/or SRE, always make sure that you have the following language engines installed:

  1. Java:latest
  2. Python:latest
  3. NodeJS: latest
  4. Docker:latest
  5. A github account and own simple repository for your personal/professional Dev/SRE profile. Optionally, setup your own domain for it.
  6. Have a Redhat Developer Account

  ### Install CRC on Windows

  To get started, open, login and click the Get Started link in [Openshift 4](https://try.openshift.com), select Clusters and then select "Run on Laptop". Fortunately, RH invested substantially to provide an installer that made it very convenient for us mortals to quickly experience Openshift 4 and be productive with it on Day 2, even if we're offline from our respective on-prem or public DC clouds.
